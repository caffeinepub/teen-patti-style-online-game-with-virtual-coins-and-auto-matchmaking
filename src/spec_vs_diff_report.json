  "summary": "Diff adds PWA manifest + service worker (with registration utility and App.tsx registration), updates index.html with PWA meta/manifest links, adds Digital Asset Links file, and introduces a dedicated Android TWA Gradle project with manifest/config aimed at packaging the deployed web app as an APK/AAB. One clear gap is that the required PWA icon image files referenced by the manifest/index.html are not shown as added in the diff.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add required PWA icons (>=192x192 and >=512x512) under frontend static assets so the manifest has valid icon URLs that are actually served.",
      "reason": "The manifest and index.html reference icon paths, but the diff does not show any added icon image files at those locations, so the installability AC about required icons may not be met.",

        "frontend/public/manifest.webmanifest (references /assets/generated/app-logo.dim_192x192.png and /assets/generated/app-logo.dim_512x512.png)",
